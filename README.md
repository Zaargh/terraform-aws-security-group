## Usage


**IMPORTANT:** We do not pin modules to versions in our examples because of the
difficulty of keeping the versions in the documentation in sync with the latest released versions.
We highly recommend that in your code you pin the version to the exact version you are
using so that your infrastructure remains stable, and update versions in a
systematic way so that they do not catch you by surprise.

Also, because of a bug in the Terraform registry ([hashicorp/terraform#21417](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/21417)),
the registry shows many of our inputs as required when in fact they are optional.
The table below correctly indicates which inputs are required.


This module is primarily for setting security group rules on a security group. You can provide the
ID of an existing security group to modify, or, by default, this module will create a new security
group and apply the given rules to it.

##### `rules` input
This module provides 2 ways to set security group rules. The `rules` input takes a list of
rule maps. The maps are compatible with (have the same keys and accept the same values) as the
Terraform [aws_security_group_rule resource](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/security_group_rule).
While some of the map keys are optional, Terraform requires that all of the maps in a single list have exactly the same set of keys.
See [WARNINGS and error messages](#warnings-and-error-messages) below for details.

##### `rule_matrix` input
The other way to set rules is via the `rule_matrix` input. This splits the keys of the `aws_security_group_rule` resource
into to sets: one set defines the rule and descripition, the other set defines the subjects of the rule. As with
`rules` and explained in the previous paragraph, all elements of the list must have all the same keys. This also holds
for all the elements of the `rules_matrix.rules` list.

Any map key that takes a list value must either be absent from all lists or contain lists in all lists.
Use an empty list rather than `null` to indicate "no value". Passing in `null` instead of a list
may cause Terraform v0.13 to crash and may cause other errors in later Terraform versions.

The schema for the `rule matrix` is:

```hcl
{
  # these top level lists define all the subjects to which rule_matrix rules will be applied
  source_security_group_ids = list of source security group IDs to apply all rules to
  cidr_blocks               = list of ipv4 CIDR blocks to apply all rules to
  ipv6_cidr_blocks          = list of ipv6 CIDR blocks to apply all rules to
  prefix_list_ids           = list of prefix list IDs to apply all rules to

  self = bool set "true" to apply the rules to the created or existing security group, null otherwise

  # each rule in the rules list will be applied to every subject defined above
  rules = [{
    type      = type of rule, either "ingress" or "egress"
    from_port = start range of protocol port
    to_port   = end range of protocol port, max is 65535
    protocol  = ip protocol name or number or "-1" for all protocols and ports

    description = free form text description of the rule
  }]
}
```

##### Create before delete
This module provides a `create_before_delete` option that will, when a security group needs to be replaced,
cause Terraform to create the new one before deleting the old one. We recommend making this `true` for new security groups,
but we default it to `false` because if you import a security group with this setting `true`, that security
group will be deleted and replaced on the first `terraform apply`, which will likely cause a service outage.

### Important Notes

##### Unexpected changes during plan and apply
The way Terraform works and the way this module is implemented causes security group rules
to be dependent on their place in the input lists. If a rule is deleted and the other rules therefore move
closer to the start of the list, those rules will be deleted and recreated. This should have no significant
operational impact, but it can make a small change look like a big one when viewing the output of
Terraform plan. After careful consideration, we have decided that this is preferable to the
impositions and limitations that would come from a solution that avoids it.

##### WARNINGS and error messages

**_Terraform v0.13 NOT SUPPORTED_**: While we currently allow use of this module with Terraform v0.13,
it has a number of known issues that are fixed in Terraform v0.14 and this module is not going
to work around. Among them are crashes due to object type conversions and the dreaded,
ubiquitous `Error: Invalid count argument`. Our recommendation if you run into these issues is
to upgrade to Terraform v0.14 or later. As a work around, avoid using `rule_matrix` and only
specify rules via the `rules` input, which has fewer issues with Terraform v0.13.

**_Objects not of the same type_**: Any time you provide a list of object, Terraform requires that all objects in the list
must be [the exact same type](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/expressions/type-constraints.html#dynamic-types-the-quot-any-quot-constraint).
This means that all maps in the list have exactly the same set of keys and that the values are all the same type.
So while some keys are optional for this module, if you include a key in any one of the maps in a list, then you
have to include that same key in all of them.
In rules where the key would othewise be omitted, include the key with value of `null`, unless the value is a
list type, in which case set the value to `[]` (an empty list), due to [#28137](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/28137).

**_Setting `inline_rules_enabled` is not recommended and NOT SUPPORTED_**: Any issues arising from setting
`inlne_rules_enabled = true` (including issues about setting it to `false` after setting it to `true`) will
not be addressed, because they flow from [fundamental problems](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/issues/20046)
with the underlying `aws_security_group` resource. The setting is provided for people who know and accept the
limitations and trade-offs and want to use it anyway. The main advantage is that when using inline rules,
Terraform will perform "drift detection" and attempt to remove any rules it finds in place but not
specified inline. See [this post](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/pull/9032#issuecomment-639545250)
for a discussion of the difference between inline and resource rules,
and some of the reasons inline rules are not satisfactory.

**_KNOWN ISSUE_** ([#20046](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/issues/20046)):
If you set `inline_rules_enabled = true`, you cannot later set it to `false`. If you try,
Terraform will [complain](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/2376) and fail.
You will either have to delete and recreate the security group or manually delete all
the security group rules via the AWS console or CLI before applying `inline_rules_enabled = false`.

## DevOps Accelerator for Startups


We are a [**DevOps Accelerator**][commercial_support]. We'll help you build your cloud infrastructure from the ground up so you can own it. Then we'll show you how to operate it and stick around for as long as you need us.

[![Learn More](https://img.shields.io/badge/learn%20more-success.svg?style=for-the-badge)][commercial_support]

Work directly with our team of DevOps experts via email, slack, and video conferencing.

We deliver 10x the value for a fraction of the cost of a full-time engineer. Our track record is not even funny. If you want things done right and you need it done FAST, then we're your best bet.

- **Reference Architecture.** You'll get everything you need from the ground up built using 100% infrastructure as code.
- **Release Engineering.** You'll have end-to-end CI/CD with unlimited staging environments.
- **Site Reliability Engineering.** You'll have total visibility into your apps and microservices.
- **Security Baseline.** You'll have built-in governance with accountability and audit logs for all changes.
- **GitOps.** You'll be able to operate your infrastructure via Pull Requests.
- **Training.** You'll receive hands-on training so your team can operate what we build.
- **Questions.** You'll have a direct line of communication between our teams via a Shared Slack channel.
- **Troubleshooting.** You'll get help to triage when things aren't working.
- **Code Reviews.** You'll receive constructive feedback on Pull Requests.
- **Bug Fixes.** We'll rapidly work with you to fix any bugs in our projects.
